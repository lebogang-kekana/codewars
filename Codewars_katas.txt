1. You are given two interior angles (in degrees) of a triangle.

Write a function to return the 3rd.

Note: only positive integers will be tested.

function otherAngle(a, b) {
  return 180-(a+b);
}

2. When provided with a String, capitalize all vowels

For example:

Input : "Hello World!"

Output : "HEllO WOrld!"

Note: Y is not a vowel in this kata.

var swap = string => string.replace(/[aeiou]/g, v => v.toUpperCase());


3. This code should store "codewa.rs" as a variable called name but it's not working. Can you figure out why?

var a = "code";
var b = "wa.rs";
var name = a + b;
